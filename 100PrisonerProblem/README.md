# 100PrisonerProblem

The [100 prisoners problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_prisoners_problem) is a mathematical problem in probability theory and combinatorics. This repository contains the code to find the probability of prisoners winning the game given they follow the optimal strategy discussed in [paper](https://www.brics.dk/RS/03/44/BRICS-RS-03-44.pdf) from University of Aarhus. Inspired by Veritasium. For context please see the following video.
