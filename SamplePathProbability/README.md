# SamplePath

Defination:

 Any set of possible values to which the appropriate random variables determined by a stochastic process might map a given point in the sample space, taken over all values of the index space 

The code calculate probability of the following problem.
 
There is a straight line marked between -1,000,000 to +1,000,000. Kate initially stands at position O. She
repeatedly tosses a fair coin that generates heads with probability 0.5, tails with probability 0.5. If she
obtains heads, she goes forward one step (current position + 1) and if she obtains tails she goes
backward one step (current position -1). She does this a million times.
We wish to localize Kate to as narrow a range as possible. Choose the best description of where she is
likely to be after the end of the process.
